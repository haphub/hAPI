# hAPI 
The hAPI library is a tool to interface Processing with the open-sourced Haply Development Kit and Hapkit haptic devices. Here you will find the documenation on how to assemble the Haply and Hapkit hardware as well as how to configure the associated development frameworks, Arduino.cc and Processing.org.

The detailed documentation can be found at: https://haphub.github.io/hAPI/

see also: https://haphub.github.io/hAPI_Fisica/ for information on how the hAPI interfaces with the hAPI Fisica physics engine to allow haptic interaction with JBox2D.
